            is represented as a NFT and you can own it? That is right, we partner up with a cryptocurrency expert
            Altlift and developed a marketplace for their own forest where each tree has its own chip and it is an
            actual NFT. Isnâ€™t that cool?

            <p>
                For starters kryptoles in english means crypto forest and it is a shared project of Altlift and
                Decentree. This NFT marketplace allows users to connect their wallet and buy trees in forest as a NFTs.
                Location of trees is then visible on google map with details such as image, price etc.

                        Company Altlift bought a part of a forest some time ago. There was not a real usage of this
                        forest. And what would you do as an expert in cryptocurrencies? Build a NFT marketplace where
                        each tree will be represented as a NFT and has its own location.

                    <p>We were really exited about this project because it combines blockchain with real objects on the
                        world.</p>

            <p>
                We developed a NFT marketplace on Polygon using Moralis for backend and also wrote some smart contracts
                in Solidity using Foundry toolchain for the development and also testing. For authetication you can
                directly use your wallet or sign in with a magic link.
            </p>
            <p>
                NFTs can also bought in auction meaning that they are sold to the highest bidder.
