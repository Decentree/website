    <Heading title="Luftio" imagePath="/images/projects/luftio_heading.jpg">IoT is for sure booming recent years and with
      AI and blockchain it is one of the most attractive markets to be on. We had the possibility to develop the whole
      product for company Luftio from web and mobile app to hardware to 3D printed box. It was one the biggest
      challenges that we ever had but we love to learn new things and be part of interesting products.</Heading>
    <TextSection index={1} max={3} title="About Luftio">
      <p>
        Luftio is a czech startup that is measuring air quality using their own sensors and then analyses and visualizes
        data in their dashboard and mobile app. The sensor itself measures CO2, temperature, humidity, pressure and VOC.
        Luftio also won several competitions such as Startup VÅ E and EON Energy Globe 2021 - category wind.

            Imagine yourself in a conference room. After a half an hour you start feeling tired and unfocused. Do you
            know why? It was most likely caused by poor air quality. This can reduce your work performance by up to 75%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another study says that 37% of employees are not satisfied woth the air quality in the workplace and 35%
            with the temperature.
          </p>
          <p> Air quality is big problem but it is even harder to solve it. </p>

      <p>
        The whole product has a two parts and that is software and hardware. So lets start with first one.</p>
      <p>We develop a web app that could be called a dashboard because it is really about visualizing data and providing
        recommendations for managers. They can make actions steps such as buy some new plants, open windows before
        regular meetings etc. For employees there is a mobile where they can see the air quality at their workspace and
        by keeping healhy air they collect badges.</p>
      <p>We were also behing the hardware engineering where we were making prototype for serial production of circuit
        boards. It was also challening to design 3D model of the box so there will be enought flow of air.
